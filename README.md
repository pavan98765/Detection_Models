# Detection Models with YOLO

Welcome to the Detection Models repository, where we leverage the power of YOLO (You Only Look Once) to create efficient and fast object detection models. Our key focus areas include the development and deployment of models for face mask detection and fire detection, essential for safety and health in various environments.

## Models Overview

- **Face Mask Detector**: Designed to identify whether individuals in the camera's view are wearing face masks. This model plays a crucial role in monitoring public health protocols.
- **Fire Detector**: A critical model for early fire detection, designed to identify fire in real-time video feeds, potentially saving lives and property by allowing for quick response.

## Using the Deployed Models

We have deployed our models to make them easily accessible for inference. Follow the links below for detailed instructions on how to use each model:
